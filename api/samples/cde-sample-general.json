When the first specimen obtained is of unacceptable quality and cannot be used, a replacement specimen is still considered the initial screen. When an initial screen is performed before 24 hrs because of a planned transfusion or an extremely ill infant, it is still considered the initial screen even though it may need to be repeated later.\n\nSubsequent screen - required by law: This answer code is used for mandatory second screens as required by law and assumes that the first screen was normal and that the second screen was performed only because it was mandated by law. For example, [give name of state(s)] currently performs a second screen on every infant born in the state at a particular point in time, such as between 1 and 2 weeks. The purpose of identifying the reason for a subsequent screen is that it will change the expected time interval when the subsequent screen should be performed.\n\nSubsequent screen - required by protocol: This answer code is used for subsequent screens that are performed because of clinical conditions in the newborn that require a repeat screen as specified by a protocol to assure valid test results. Many of these subsequent screens have abnormal or out-of-range results on the initial screen that can be explained by the clinical condition of the infant. Typical examples include premature infants, infants who receive blood product transfusions, and infants who are receiving intravenous alimentation. This category should not include abnormal tests that should be considered presumptive positives (which would require a diagnostic evaluation rather than a repeat screen by protocol). The purpose of identifying the reason for a subsequent screen is that it will change the expected time interval when the subsequent screen should be performed.\n\n\nSubsequent screen - for clarification of initial results (not by law or protocol): When the results of the initial screen are abnormal or out of range, many states perform an \"immediate\" repeat screen to confirm the results before considering the test a presumptive positive that will require a diagnostic evaluation. Many of these results may be considered or reported as equivocal or borderline until a clear abnormality is confirmed on the subsequent screen. This category does not include abnormal or borderline results for which there is a clear clinical explanation, such as prematurity, for which there is a clear protocol for obtaining a second screen. The purpose of identifying the reason for a subsequent screen is that it will change the expected time interval when the subsequent screen should be performed.\n\nSubsequent screen - reason unknown: The purpose of identifying the reason for a subsequent screen is that it will change the expected time interval when the subsequent screen should be performed. States should use this answer code if they are unable to identify the specific reason for a subsequent screen, but they are able to separate initial screens from subsequent screens. The reason for the second screen might be any of the above. A repeat initial screen because the first specimen was of unacceptable quality should not be considered a subsequent screen, but some states may use this code if they are unable to track that the reason for a second specimen was unacceptable quality of the first screen.\n\nNo sample collected due to parental refusal: This answer code is used to document parental refusal of newborn screening so that a report can be generated which will contain no test results because no specimen was submitted. This will enable complete matching of newborn screening results to all infants born even if no laboratory testing was performed.","tags":["TERM

Thyroid treatments (PTU - propylthiouracil, methimazole (tapazole), and radioactive iodine (I-131)) can affect NBS results for T4 and TSH. Steroid treatment (prednisone, betamethasone, dexamethasone) can affect NBS results for 17-OHP. Fatty liver of pregnancy and HELLP syndrome can affect NBS results for acylcarnitines. TPN can affect NBS results for amino acids and fatty acids. PRBC (packed red blood cell) transfusion can affect NBS results for GALT and hemoglobin.

Select any answers that apply; you can select more than one answer. If you select \"other,\" use the additional narrative LOINC code for \"Other infant NICU factors that affect newborn screening interpretation\" to give additional details. Select the answer \"Infant in ICU at time of specimen collection\" if the infant was in an intensive care unit, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or special care baby unit (SCBU). ECMO (extra corporeal membrane oxygenation, aka heart-lung bypass) can affect NBS results for hemoglobinopathies and GALT. Dopamine can affect NBS results for TSH. Steroid treatment can affect NBS results for TSH and 17-OHP. Iodine can affect NBS results for TSH and T4. Antibiotics can affect NBS results for C5. Some anti-seizure medications can affect NBS results for fatty acids. In screening for cystic fibrosis (CF), those babies presenting with meconium ileus or other bowel obstruction often have falsely low IRT's, so some states when they have that information, skip the IRT and go directly to DNA for their screen.
